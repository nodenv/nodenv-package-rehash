# nodenv-package-rehash

**Never run `nodenv rehash` again.**

This nodenv plugin automatically
runs `nodenv rehash` every time you install or uninstall a global package.

## Installation

After installation, you should have a `nodenv package-hooks` subcommand,
and the package-rehash hook should be included in the output of
`nodenv hooks install`.

Then you may install the hooks for your existing nodenv versions.
(This will be done automatically for any node you install henceforth.)

```sh
nodenv package-hooks install --all
```

### install via Git _(recommended)_

Install the plugin:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv-package-rehash.git "$(nodenv root)"/plugins/nodenv-package-rehash
```

### install via Homebrew

```sh
brew install nodenv/nodenv/nodenv-package-rehash
```

### install via npm

```sh
npm i -g @nodenv/nodenv-package-rehash
```

This method is not recommended, because of the likelihood that the nodenv plugin gets installed under a node being _managed_ by nodenv.
If using this method, it is highly recommended to install the plugin into your `system` node.

Also note, this package requires a package level npm postinstall hook to ensure the nodenv-install hook is found by `nodenv hooks install`.
If you install this package with lifecycle hooks disabled, you will need to do this manually either by a one-time symlink:

```sh
ln -s "$(npm -g prefix)/lib/node_modules/@nodenv/nodenv-package-rehash/etc/nodenv.d/install/install-pkg-hooks.bash" "$(nodenv root)/nodenv.d/install/package-rehash.bash
```

or by configuring `NODENV_HOOK_PATH` in your shell startup:

```sh
export NODENV_HOOK_PATH=$(npm -g prefix)/lib/node_modules/@nodenv/nodenv-package-rehash/etc/nodenv.d/:$NODENV_HOOK_PATH
```

## Configuration _(optional)_

With this plugin, rehashing will happen on-demand (when global npm modules are installed/uninstalled).
You can take advantage of this and remove nodenv's _automatic_ hashing upon [shell initialization][].
In your shell startup file (`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`), add the `--no-rehash` flag to the `nodenv init -` invocation:

```sh
eval "$(nodenv init - --no-rehash)"
```

This will speed up your shell initialization since nodenv will no longer need to rehash on every startup.

## Usage

1. `npm install -g` a package that provides executables.
2. Marvel at how you no longer need to type `nodenv rehash`.

### Subcommands

Three sub commands are available for manual hook management.

1. `nodenv package-hooks list [ --all | <version-name>... ]`

   Lists any hooks installed for the given version(s)

2. `nodenv package-hooks install [ --all | <version-name>... ]`

   Installs postinstall/postuninstall rehash hooks for the given version(s)

3. `nodenv package-hooks uninstall [ --all | <version-name>... ]`

   Uninstalls postinstall/postuninstall rehash hooks for the given version(s)

All three sub commands accept similar arguments:

1. no arg: applies the command only to the currently active node version
2. version-name: a whitespace-separate list of 1 or more explicit versions (e.g. 0.10.24)
3. `--all`: applies the command to all installed versions

## How It Works

nodenv-package-rehash consists of two parts:
an npm postinstall (and postuninstall) hook script and a nodenv plugin.

The npm script hooks into npm's `postinstall` and `postuninstall` lifecycle events
(corresponding to `npm install -g` and `npm uninstall -g`) to run `nodenv rehash`,
ensuring newly installed package executables are visible to nodenv.

The nodenv plugin is responsible for installing the npm hook script.
It relies on nodenv's `install` hook to copy the npm hook script into node's global `node_modules/.hooks/`.

For users who install this plugin via npm, there is also a package postinstall hook
which will install the nodenv-install hook into the `NODENV_HOOK_PATH`.

## Caveats

Automatic rehashing after installation of global packages does _not_ work with versions of npm `^5.1.0 || ~6.0.1`.
If you use one of the affected versions of npm,
you will need to run `nodenv rehash` manually after installing global packages.
It is recommended to upgrade to a version of npm 6.1.0 or later (or stay on a version prior to 5.1.0).

npm version 5.1.0 [broke global package hooks][issue] ([npm/cli@e084987][npm-cli]) and they remained broken until 6.1.0 ([npm/npm-lifecycle#13][npm-lifecycle]).
Node versions 8.2.0 through 10.2.1 (inclusive) ship with affected versions of npm.
